Calc III - Vector Calculus (Sample Notes)

Course context:
- This is a second-year university course on multivariable calculus.
- Students know single-variable calculus and basic linear algebra.

Topics:
- Vector fields in R^2 and R^3
- Gradient, divergence, and curl
- Line integrals of vector fields
- Conservative vector fields and potential functions
- Green's theorem in the plane
- Flux integrals and the divergence theorem

Key ideas:
- The gradient ∇f points in the direction of steepest increase of a scalar field f.
- Divergence measures the “net flow out” of a point in a vector field.
- Curl measures the “rotation” or tendency to spin in a vector field.
- Green's theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to a double integral over the region.
- The divergence theorem relates flux through a closed surface to a triple integral of divergence over the volume.

Typical exam question styles:
- Compute div F or curl F at a specific point.
- Determine whether a vector field is conservative and, if so, find a potential function.
- Evaluate a line integral directly and using Green's theorem.
- Interpret physical meaning of divergence or curl for a given field.
